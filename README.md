Implementation of the Lattice Boltzmann method using one inflow boundary (ze/hou drichlet), one no slip bounce back boundary and an outflow boundary to simulate von Karman vertices.
I uses the BGK collision operator.
This implentation has no optimizations and was made just as a means to better understand the method.
